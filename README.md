This project was created for Computer Science 309 - Software Development Practices

# Game Summary
<p>Absolute Conquest is a strategy turn based board and card game. The game is divided into two phases. During the first phase, players place terrain cards from their decks onto the board.
After all players have placed their terrain cards, the second and main phase of the game begins. During this phase players may play one unit card from their hand and as many trap cards as
they would like from their hand onto valid spaces on the board each turn. Players keep moving units and fighting the opposing units until they can move a unit onto their opponents capital.
When a capital is taken over, a player is eliminated until only one player remains and is declared the winner. After the game, players are given gold that they can use to buy card packs
from the shop and create new decks to play with. </p>

 to include and were nominated for best project in the class by our TA. </p>
